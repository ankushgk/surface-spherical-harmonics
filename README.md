# Surface Spherical Harmonics

One can expand a function as a combination of basis functions of the space in which it exists. On a sphere, the basis functions are the solutions to the Laplace equation - Spherical Harmonics.
So how would someone describe scalar fields that exist on the surface of a sphere? What about vector fields? What about symmetric and traceless second-rank tensor fields? [^1][^2]

The Mathematica Notebook computes the orthonormal Surface Scalar, Vector and Tensor Spherical Harmonics. Only the traceless and symmetric Surface Tensor Spherical Harmonics are computed. Tests for Orthonormality, and values for specific modes can also be computed. 

A conversion of the harmonics from spherical to cartesian coordinates is also done.
