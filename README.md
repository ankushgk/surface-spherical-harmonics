# Surface Spherical Harmonics

One can expand a function as a combination of basis functions of the space in which it exists. On a sphere, the basis functions are the solutions to the laplace equation - Spherical Harmonics.
So how would someone desribe scalar fields that exist on the surface of a sphere? What about vector fields? What about symmetric and traceless second-rank tensor fields?
